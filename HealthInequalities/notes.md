## About the company
- ML to identify respiritory issues
- Focused on child health
- A questionairre + digitised instruments (stethoscope or themometer)


## Analysis
- Collect audio from breathing
    - wheezing
    - cackles
    - etc
- "Truth" is from the doctors but their assessments vary widely
- Data available for modelling (eg via hospital or uni) is widely different from out in a rural Indian village, for example
- Data profile changes by geography & data source


## Challenges
- Needs to deploy "at the edge" because even within a small area internet connectivity will be patchy or non-existent
